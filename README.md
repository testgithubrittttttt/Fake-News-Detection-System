## Introduction
Fake News Detection is a critical challenge in the era of digital information. This project aims to detect fake news articles using advanced machine learning techniques. The system is built to identify patterns and features that distinguish fake news from real news.

## Features
1. Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data for model training.
2. Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF for extracting features from text.
3. Model Training: Includes various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and more.
4. Evaluation: Measures performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualization: Provides insights into model performance and data distribution through visualizations.

## Datasets
The project utilizes the following datasets from Kaggle:

- Fake News: Fake News Dataset - Contains fake news articles for training.
- Real News: True News Dataset - Contains real news articles for training.

## Models
The project employs the following models:

- Logistic Regression: Effective for binary classification problems.
- Naive Bayes: Known for its efficiency with text data.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): For high-dimensional spaces.
- Random Forest: Ensemble method for better performance.

## Results
Model performance is evaluated using:

1. Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
2. Precision: Indicates the proportion of true positives.
3. Recall: Reflects the model's ability to capture all relevant instances.
4. F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Fake_News_Detection.ipynb notebook.
